# CHANGELOG: 2020/03/20

## Released fixes 2020/03/20
    * Not good at updating this when I debug
    * Fixing problems with generating the correct kmer distribution files
    * Allow for non-ncbi taxonomy files (notably, root node does NOT have to be the first line in the nodes.dmp file anymore) 
    * Allow for non-traditional nodes for abundance estimation (e.g. abundance estimation of S1 taxons) 

## 2020/01/08 Update
    * Fixed generate_kmer_distrib.py script to use the taxid instead of the seqid in map file 
    * New Year
